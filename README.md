Lecture Notes on Relativistic Quantum Fields
============================================

A repository of my notes based around the Relativistic Quantum Fields
course taught at the University of Glasgow. These notes may be (and
probably are) riddled with mistakes, so use at your own risk!

The LaTeX files contained in this repository have a number of
dependencies, which I shall list in due course.
