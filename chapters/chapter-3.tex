A physical field is normally governed by two restrictions; a
differential equation, and boundary conditions, but they can be
described using the Lagrangian and the principle of least action.

\begin{definition}[Action]
  Action is the quantity
  \[ S = \int \Lag(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi) \dd[4]{x} \]
  for $\Lag$ the Lagrangian, itegrated over all space-time.
\end{definition}

A field adopts a configuration to reduce the action to a minimum. To
find this we look for the infinitessimal variations which leave the
action unchanged, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \phi(x) \to \phi(x) + \delta \phi(x) \quad | \quad S \to S + \delta S 
\end{equation}
with $\delta S = 0$.
