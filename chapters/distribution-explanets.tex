% HD\,209458\,b was the first planet to have a spectroscopic signature
% of sodium discovered in its atmosphere, but at an intensity lower than
% was expected, suggesting that high clouds obscure the lower layers of
% the atmosphere. The planet's spectrum is extracted by subtracting the
% stellar spectrum from the overall spectrum.
