Quantum mechanics is a framework for describing physics in terms of
wavefunctions, which encode all of the physical properties of a
system. An observable of a system---a property which can be
measured---is described by the operation of a Hermitian operator on
the wavefunction. An observation corresponds to a specific eigenvalue
of the operator corresponding to the observable.

In classical mechanics all observables can be measured to infinite
precision, but in quantum mechanics there is a limit to the precision
at which different variables can be simultaneously measured.
